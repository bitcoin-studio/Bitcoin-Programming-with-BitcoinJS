= Bitcoin Programming with BitcoinJS, Bitcoin Core and LND

Welcome to the non-official _Bitcoin Programming with BitcoinJS_ extensive guide! You will learn how to create various types of Bitcoin transactions using the https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib[BitcoinJS^] library.

We will use the Bitcoin Core command-line interface in Regtest mode for various common tasks, as well as some complementary libraries like `bx` aka https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer[Libbitcoin Explorer^].

Throughout this guide, we want to provide you with sufficient explanation to each command to understand it without drowning in information. You can refer to additional resources to better understand the Bitcoin protocol. For example, check out our https://www.bitcoin-studio.com/resources[Bitcoin Studio presentations^].

At the moment, Bitcoin Javascript tutorials are still very scarce, but we believe it doesn't have to be this way. The following guide intends to address this problem.

This guide is maintained on https://github.com/bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-Programming-with-BitcoinJS[GitHub^] and available as a
https://bitcoinjs-guide.bitcoin-studio.com[web book^]. It is written in awesome AsciiDoc and generated using the kickass https://antora.org/[Antora^] site generator.

== Repository Structure

- The Master branch contains the Antora playbook, the UI project, and the UI bundle. +
The UI project build then packages the UI into a
bundle, which the UI Loader in Antora consumes. Antora grabs the bundle, extracts it into a UI catalog, and takes compilation to
completion by weaving the Antoraâ€™s content model into the Handlebars templates to make the pages and auxiliary data files.
Antora then copies the remaining UI assets to the site output.

.Generates the UI bundle
 npm install
 gulp bundle

.Build the website
 antora antora-playbook.yml

- The Documentation Components stored in versioned branches (v4, v5, ...).
